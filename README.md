## The EngineerDAO Platform

EngineerDAO is a product-focused group of individuals obsessed with manifesting the "Internet of Jobs". Our product is an anonymous, permissionless marketplace for software engineers to match with paid projects, tasks, and jobs.

## Vision

Our vision is two-fold; optimistically solving for both supply and demand. Engineers should imagine the EngineerDAO Platform as an API that returns cryptocurrency for correct inputs (code) over a given period of time. We envision a diverse marketplace, with jobs of all shapes and sizes. Our goal is to maximally reduce friction in your quest to trade time for money - be it a 30 minute lunch break, 2 hours after work, or a full-time endeavor.

Suppliers (those with work to be done) will realize a new paradigm on the EngineerDAO Platform. Our mission is to reduce risk and align incentives. When an engineer accepts your project, they put ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù via a buy-in. Together, the supplier‚Äôs bounty and the engineer‚Äôs buy-in are locked in a smart contract. If the engineer fails to deliver, the buy-in is forfeited to the supplier. Although not the ideal scenario, the supplier is at least compensated for their time. This is how we align incentives and level the playing field.

EngineerDAO contracts are trust-less working agreements that allow both parties to put "skin in the game" to complete a task. We do not rely on reputation, past working relationships, networking, or even language barriers. The engineer must decide if the contact is a good fit for them - so much so that they're willing to lose money if they're wrong.

We believe this is how the Internet of Jobs goes world-scale and [solves many of the legacy work arrangement issues experienced today.](https://www.notion.so/Philosophy-bbdcbd3ce17e40aea62fa61f2441572f)

EngineerDAO imagines contracts as contained, well-defined, testable tasks that outsource their implementation - but not integration. We capitalize on the experience that many software engineering tasks are 90% implementing a design, and 10% integration.

## How it works

## Step 1: Contract Creation üìú

A supplier (party that needs work done) create a contract in EngineerDAO. They list acceptance criteria, labels, description, timeframe, the bounty price, and the buy-in price.

The contract is created and listed when the supplier funds the contract with the bounty price.

## Step 2: Engineer Buy-In üí∞

An engineer (party looking for work) find a contract that meets their needs. The work looks doable and the price is right.

The contract starts when the engineer funds the buy-in price. **Bounty and buy-in are now locked in the contract** and can only be withdrawn via specific rules. In the happy path, funds are transferred to the engineer in Step 5. See Sad Paths below for other scenarios.

## Step 3: Doing the Work üíª

The engineer and supplier collaborate to complete the contract requirements. The nature of this stage varies greatly!

## Step 4: Approval üëç

Once satisfied with the submitted work, the supplier approves the contract manually or via automated tests.

## Step 5: Contract Completion üéâ

The contract completes when the supplier is satisfied with the submitted work, within the agreed upon timeframe. When the supplier clicks "Accept", **the contract automatically pays out the bounty + buy-in to the engineer** and closes the contract.
