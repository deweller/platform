### Running tests

Run unit tests for all packages in parallel via:

```bash
yarn test

To run unit tests for a specific package:

cd package-to-test
yarn test
```

### Running contract static analysis

We perform static analysis with [`slither`](https://github.com/crytic/slither). You must have Python 3.x installed to
run `slither`. To run `slither` locally, do:

```bash
cd packages/contracts
pip3 install slither-analyzer
yarn test:slither
```
